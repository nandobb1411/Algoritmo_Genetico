# Genetic_algorithm

In this project, we will examine the functionality of a genetic algorithm through the lens of a case study on monkey survival. Using Google Colab as our platform, we will analyze the utility of this computational approach in understanding the adaptive capabilities of a population. By the end of this project, you will have a deeper understanding of the principles and applications of a genetic algorithm.
